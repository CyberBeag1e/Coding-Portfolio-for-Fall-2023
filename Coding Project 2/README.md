# Coding Project 2: Binomial Pricing of Options
In this project, I constructed 2 binomial option pricing models. The first one uses python `list`, which is efficient and powerful. To make it more straightforward, I defined a `printTree()` method to visualize the tree. The second one uses the customized `binaryTree` class, which is intuitive, but less efficient than the built-in `list` class. So I discard it, and only show the visualization result of the first one.

The project was initially designed to facilitate my calculation in the homeworks of *Derivatives Pricing and Applications* course.
