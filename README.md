# Coding-Portfolio-for-Fall-2023
I'm a senior student in Peking University, China. This portfolio is designed for my applications of master's degree in Data Science/Analtytics(2023 Fall)

I include several scripts for my coding projects, some of which are final projects of courses, while others are for my interst, using programming to facilitate my study and calculations in my homeworks.

I'm not a computer science major, so there's no comprehensive projects in my portfolio, and maybe some syntax is a little "na√Øve" for CS major students. However, I'm working hard on it, building up my programming knowledge and making my scripts simpler and more efficient.
