# Coding Project 3: Pattern Detection
In this project, I establish a model to detect a pattern, such as a face or a logo. Inspired by the lecture of the *Deep Learning* course, I first defined a `ResBlock` class, and constructed several blocks into a `ResNet` model, which I referred to https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_41544329/article/details/103302494. You can specify the parameters, changing it into ResNet18 or ResNet34. Then I customized a `PatternDetection` class for pattern detection. 

However, as the ResNet model has millions of parameters, which requires considerable computing power of the computer, the training process of the model cannot be completed on my personal computer. Therefore, I did not train the model or show the final prediction results. But I still want to show my ideas in this pattern detection project, so I include it as my third coding project.
